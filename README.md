# Introduction
This is an example project outling basic QA testing in Unity

Requires Unity `2019.2` or higher

## Installing the Test Runner Package in Unity
(project already contains Unity's Test Framework Package, not required)

- **Open Unity Package Manager**: Navigate to `Window` > `Package Manager` in the Unity Editor.
- **Install Unity Test Framework**: Find and select "Unity Test Framework" from the package list, then click "Install."
- **Learn basic setup of Test Assemblies**: Unity's documentation is great on this topic. [See More](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.1/manual/getting-started.html)

## Running Unit Tests
1. Navigate to `Window` > `General` > `Test Runner` to open the `Test Runner` window.
2. Ensure all unit tests are listed.
3. Select and run the tests using the `Run All` button or run individual tests with the `Run` button beside each test.

## Editor vs Play Mode Tests
- **Editor Tests**: Run in the Unity Editor.
  - Example: `MathExtensions.cs` tests are editor tests. They test basic math functions used in the application, independent of the game's runtime state.
  - Example: `SceneTests.cs` tests components and interactions within a current scene.
- **Play Mode Tests**: Run while the game is playing.
  - Example: `PlayModeTests.cs` contain tests that load a scene and test functionality while the game is playing.

## Example Game Overview
We will be working on a genre-defining Item Collection Adventure game. In this game, players must collect various items to pass-through doors, and reaching the end of the level.
