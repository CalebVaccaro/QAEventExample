# Introduction
We will delve into the world of game development, focusing on quality assurance (QA) to ensure that our game provides a seamless and enjoyable experience for players.

- This is an example project overvewing QA testing in Unity

## Game Overview
We will be working on a genre-defining Item Collection Adventure game. In this game, players must collect various items to overcome obstacles and pass through a wall, ultimately reaching the end of the level.

## Agenda

- YouTrack Tutorial: Learn how to use YouTrack, a project management tool, to track and manage our tasks.
- Live QA Session: Review two QA tickets, experiencing a day in the life of a game developer.

### Tools and Resources
Game Code: All the game code is available on [GitHub]().
